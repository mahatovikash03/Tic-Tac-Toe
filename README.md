## ðŸ“š How I Built It

I built this project by watching a Tic Tac Toe game tutorial to understand how each part works. I paused, rewrote parts of the code, and took help from the tutorial when stuck. This helped me deeply understand:

- How to select and manipulate DOM elements
- How to track user turns using a Boolean flag
- How to add dynamic classes for styling moves
- How to use event listeners for user interaction
